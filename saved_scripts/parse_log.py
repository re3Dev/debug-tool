Check the USB connection between the Raspberry Pi (or host machine) and the mainboard. Over time, vibrations can loosen the connectors.

Solution:
1. Power off the printer.
2. Unplug and replug the USB cable connecting the Raspberry Pi to the mainboard.
3. Power the printer back on.
4. If the issue persists, try using a different USB cable or port.

    "max31856 over/under voltage/thermocouple out of range/thermocouple reader fault": """
These errors are typically related to thermocouple issues, often caused by static buildup, grounding problems, or a faulty thermocouple.

Solution:
1. Turn off the machine.
2. Unplug the yellow thermocouple connectors.
3. Turn the machine back on.
4. Press ‚ÄòRestart‚Äô on the touchscreen when booted up.
5. Plug the yellow thermocouple connectors back in.
6. Press ‚ÄòFirmware_Restart‚Äô on the touchscreen.

Further Troubleshooting:
- If the issue persists, copy the extruder and bed heater sections from `/build/fff_heaters.cfg` and paste them into the standalone config file.  
- Adjust the min and max temperature values to `-273.15` and `999999` to bypass the error and identify the faulty thermocouple.
- Inspect the yellow thermocouple connector at the toolhead for loose wires. Use a precision screwdriver to expose more wire if needed.

This error occurs when the emergency stop button is pressed in the software.

Solution:
1. Press ‚ÄòFirmware_Restart‚Äô to restore normal operation.
""",

    "move out of range": """
The printer attempted to move beyond its allowed range, often due to incorrect movement mode settings.

Solution:
1. Check the console output for the coordinates that caused the error.
2. If the error involves X or Y movement, ensure the axis is set to absolute mode.
   
   - Relative Mode: `G1 X10` moves the X axis **+10 from its last position**.
   - Absolute Mode: `G1 X10` moves the X axis **to coordinate (10, 10)**.

3. To fix the issue, add `G90` to your start G-code to enforce absolute positioning.
""",

    "move exceeds maximum extrusion": """
This error is often caused by a slicer issue where an excessive extrusion amount is requested.

Solution:
1. Ensure your start G-code includes `G92 E0` before any extrusion commands.
2. Verify that your slicer‚Äôs flow settings are correct.
3. If the problem persists, adjust safety limits in the configuration:
   - Copy `/build/fff_extruders.cfg` and paste it into `standalone.cfg`.
   - Increase `max_extrude_cross_section` and `max_extrude_only_distance`.
   - Save the changes and restart the printer.
